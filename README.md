# C Coding

Few projects made for an university course back in 2016.

## Brief description

Here are 3 out of many projects that were one of the first lines of code that I've ever written.
I've chosen these three, 'cause they're a bit longer and they consist of some more **advanced pointer** and **memory allocation**.

### Image Processing 1

### Image Processing 2

### Stack-Based Normal Polish Notation Calculator

Stack implementation with simple **push, pop, empty and print** methods.
Additionally it has a **read_options** method which gets user input from the stream and calculates the output as if it was a
[Polish Notation Calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation) in which operators precede their operands.
